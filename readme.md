# WPGIT

## Usage

This plugin can be used on develpment phase on your website. It display the current branch and give logs information on front. Typically, it is used during the QA/UAT or dev phase when several teams consult the site and there are a lot of branch changes, in order to avoid launching functionality tests on a bad branch.

## Requirement for use

Have a repository (.git) to root folder of your Wordpress installation.
